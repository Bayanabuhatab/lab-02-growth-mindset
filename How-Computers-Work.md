# what makes acomputer Acomputer?

*A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

# How information is Represented using electricity?

*Any kind of information can be represented as binary digits of 1 or 0. This includes numbers (which would just have to be converted into binary), words (for which there are standards like Unicode to translate into binary), and any other kind of information. Computers can represent these binary digits by either storing an electric charge for all the 1s, or having no stored charge for 0. The poster above me describes more about how this storage works, but essentially, all your information is converted to binary and then represented using electric charge.



# What's the difference between hardware and software?

The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute—and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't really think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called software. They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful—and that's why millions of us can no longer live without them!
