# java-Script

*Javascribt is using where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity.
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script, then we can link JavaScript file from HTML page by use the HTML
Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored (it have .js extenstion)

# STATEMENTS
________________
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.


# Comments
___________________________

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

# MULTI-LINE COMMENTS
____________
Multi-line comments are often used for descriptions of how the script works, or to prevent a section of the script from running when testing it. To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the * / characters.

# SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS
____________________
In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Singleline comments are often used for short descriptions of what the code is doing.

# Variables
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. the data stored in a variable can change its follow for example “ var name = data “
________________
# Data Type
-NUMERIC : The numeric data type handles numbers.
-STRING : The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.
-BOOLEAN : Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false

# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

1-The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.

2-The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name

3-You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable.
Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.

4-All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.

5-Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person’s first name, last Name for their last name, and age for their age.

6-If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, first Name rather than firstname (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
