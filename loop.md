# Java allows us to make web pages more interactive . This can be in some steps:
-access content

-modify content

-program rules

-react of events

# The basic of programming :
-What is a script and how do I create one ?
-How do computers fit in with the world around them
-How do I write a script for a web page?

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

# A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

To write a script, we need to first state ourr goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

# Expressions
rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

# Functions
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

To create function we give it a name and then write the statements nedeed to acheieve its task inside the curly braces .

# For, While and Do While LOOP in JavaScript How to use Loop?
Loops are useful when you have to execute the same lines of code repeatedly, for a specific number of times or as long as a specific condition is true.
Suppose you want to type a ‘Hello’ message 100 times in your webpage. Of course, you will have to copy and paste the same line 100 times. Instead, if you use loops, you can complete this task in just 3 or 4 lines. Different Types of Loops** There are mainly four types of loops in JavaScript. for loop** for/in a loop (explained later)** while loop do…while loop
