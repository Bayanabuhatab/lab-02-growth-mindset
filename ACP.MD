## Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

Local Version Control
Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
